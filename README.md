Quick PoC for the concept of [this tweet](https://x.com/miaaowing/status/2016573470415437919) not guarenteed to run on everything or work perfectly but in my minimal testing it worked, will release a jar when I feel more confident, for now this was a hackathon type thing I am going to bed, feel free to compile jar yourself!

0.05 is the default but for a good experience I reccomend around ~0.15 for the minimum volume!

Tested and ran on MC version 1.21.11
